"# LAN_CHAT" 
A modern, real-time Local Area Network (LAN) chat application built with Python. Chat with friends on the same WiFi without internet!

## ✨ Features
- **🔌 No Internet Required:** Works completely on Local Area Network(WiFi).
- **💬 Modern UI:** WhatsApp-style interface using `customtkinter`(Dark             Mode & Chat Bubbles).
- **📂 File Sharing:** Send Images, PDFs, and Documents (with manual                download option).
- **✍️ Typing Indicator:** Real-time status update ("Gowtham is typing...").
- **😃 Emoji Support:** Send expressive messages with emojis.
- **🚀 Standalone App:** Can be converted to `.exe`, so friends don't need          Python installed.
